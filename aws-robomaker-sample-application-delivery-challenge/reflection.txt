a. What is mapping in autonomous robotics? 

Mapping in autonomous robotics is a discipline of computer vision and cartography.

b. How important is the map’s accuracy for the robot’s autonomous navigation task? 

It is important because the robot needs position accuracy of the map to determine and view the environments. 
It contributes to determination of the further process and actions of robots.

c. What are dynamic objects in autonomous robotics? Either explain or provide some examples. 

It is the objects occur in the environments that is with the moving status. For example, human is the dynamic objects
to the automatic door operator. Once someone is closer, the door would detect the object and process the open operation.


d. Should the dynamic objects be present when mapping an arena? Explain the reason for your answer.

It is not necessary to have dynamic objets in this case. We don’t have the requirement of certain movement of objects.
The dynamic objects only presents once the there are some possibilities of occurrence of moving objects.
